<title>Baer Hendrix. Maker Champion (to be...) for the city of Venlo</title>
Introducing myself:
I'm Baer, 38 years old, born, raised and living in the beautiful city of Venlo. I'm married to Cindy and have to awsome children, 
Flynn (10) and Emma (7). I followed a social study and started working for an employment agency during my study. After 8 years I needed
and found another challenge and started working for the Municipality of Venlo as a coach for people who receive welfare benefit.
Working with people with a (big) distance to the labourmarket is very fullfilling for me. That's what I've been doimng the last 3 years
within KanDoen. I find work for people who need a sheltered environment to work in or at least coaching in the work they do.
My expectations of the Pop Machina Academy:
Learn, learn, learn and then learn even more...
