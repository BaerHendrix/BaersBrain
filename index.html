<h1>Baer Hendrix. Maker Champion (to be...) for the city of Venlo</h1>
<p>Introducing myself:
<p>I'm Baer, 38 years old, born, raised and living in the beautiful city of Venlo. I'm married to Cindy and have two awsome children, 
  Flynn (10) and Emma (7).</p> 
  <p>I followed a social study and started working for an employment agency during my study. After 8 years I needed and found another challenge and started working for the Municipality of Venlo as a coach for people who receive welfare benefit.<p/>
<p>Working with people with a (big) distance to the labourmarket is very fullfilling for me. That's what I've been doing the last 3 years within KanDoen. I find work for people who need a sheltered environment to work in or at least coaching in the work they do.<p/>
  <p>My expectations of the Pop Machina Academy:</p>
  <p>Learn, learn, learn and then learn even more...</p>
